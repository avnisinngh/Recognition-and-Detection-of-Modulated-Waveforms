# Modulation Recognition and Detection System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **automatic recognition and classification of modulated waveforms** using **machine learning**. It generates, processes, and classifies signals like **QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, 32APSK, and 64APSK** using a **RandomForestClassifier** with feature extraction and visualization.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Automatic Modulation Recognition** – Detects modulation type from input signals.  
✔ **Machine Learning Model** – Uses **RandomForestClassifier** to classify waveforms.  
✔ **Feature Extraction** – Extracts **statistical** and **frequency-domain** features from signals.  
✔ **Signal Visualization** – Includes **constellation diagrams, scatter plots, and confusion matrices**.  
✔ **Interactive CLI** – Allows users to **train models, test signals, and view results**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
